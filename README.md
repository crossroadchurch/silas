# Silas
*Silas improves lyrics and signalling.*

Silas is a companion app built to run along side [Paul](https://github.com/crossroadchurch/paul). In its current state, Silas is barely functional and is __not__ suitable for production.

### Installation
Once reasonably stable, Silas will be published to npm.

For the time being, clone the github repository and install.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crossroadchurch/silas
cd silas
npm install
```

### Development
To run the development server, use `devServer.js`. The package.json already has a script to do this.

```bash
npm start
```

### Production
To run in production (or just so that you can connect from other devices locally)...

```bash
npm run production
```
